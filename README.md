# Know-where-it-is!!!
‘Know where it is!’ is a website which allows users to search nearby shops where the
product that they need is available, when they are visiting a new place. When we are visiting
or relocating to any new place, it is very hard and time consuming to figure out where to get
some necessary products, so our website will provide information and locations of all the shops
which have the product that we are looking for. It also help the buyer to get a best buy.

Note: The project report is commited here, for the code mail to jayasurya217@gmail.com
